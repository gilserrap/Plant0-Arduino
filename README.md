Plant0-Arduino
==============

This project was made to be able to monitor various plant's soil moisture, soil temperature, ambient humidity, ambient temperature and ambient light, through an iOS app.

In this repo you'll find the arduino sketch I used to log data into Cariots, with the following components:

  - 1xArduino YÃºn.
  - 4xGrove Moisture Sensors.
  - 1xGrove Temperature & Humidity Sensor.
  - 1xGrove Light Sensor.
  - 1xGrove Base Shield V1.3.
  - 1xSeeedstudio One Wire Temperature Sensor.
